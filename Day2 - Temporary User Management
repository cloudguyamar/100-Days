üöÄ Day 2 of 100 Days of DevOps: Temporary User Management

üñ•Ô∏è Server Details
Server Name	IP	Hostname	User	Password	Purpose
stapp01	172.16.*.*	stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com	tony	I**nMn	Nautilus App 1
stapp02	172.16.*.*	stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com	steve	A**ric	Nautilus App 2

üìã Lab Overview
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named kirsty requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:

 
Create a user named kirsty on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-02-17, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.
Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.

üîß Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Connect to App Server 1
# SSH into App Server 1 (stapp01 - Nautilus App 1)
ssh tony@stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
# OR using IP address
ssh tony@172.16.*.*

# Enter password when prompted: I**nMn
Step 2: Switch to Root User
# Switch to root for user management operations
sudo su -
Step 3: Create User with Expiry Date
# Create user 'kirsty' with expiry date 2024-02-17
useradd -e 2024-02-17 kirsty
Alternative command options:

# Using different date format
useradd --expiredate 2024-02-17 kirsty

# Create user first, then set expiry
useradd kirsty
chage -E 2024-02-17 kirsty
Step 4: Verify User Creation and Expiry
# Check if user was created successfully
id kirsty

# Verify user entry in passwd file
grep kirsty /etc/passwd

# Check user's expiry date
chage -l kirsty

# Alternative method to check expiry
passwd -S kirsty
‚úÖ Validation Steps
‚úÖ User kirstycreated successfully
‚úÖ User expiry date set to 2024-02-17
‚úÖ User entry exists in /etc/passwd
‚úÖ User created in lowercase as per protocol
