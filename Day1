📋 Lab Overview
To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell. Here's your task:

Create a user named kareem with a non-interactive shell on App Server 1.
Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.

🔧 Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Connect to App Server 1
# SSH into App Server 1 (stapp01 - Nautilus App 1)
ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
# OR using IP address
ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com

# Enter password when prompted: I**nMn
Step 2: Switch to Root User
# Switch to root for user management operations
sudo su -
Step 3: Create User with Non-Interactive Shell
# Create user 'kareem' with /sbin/nologin as shell
useradd -s /sbin/nologin kareem
Alternative command options:

# Option 1: Using /bin/false as non-interactive shell
useradd -s /bin/false kareem

# Option 2: Using /usr/sbin/nologin (on some systems)
useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin kareem
Step 4: Verify User Creation
# Check if user was created successfully
id kareem

# Verify the shell assignment
grep kareem /etc/passwd

# Check user's home directory
ls -la /home/ | grep kareem
✅ Validation Steps
✅ User javed created successfully
✅ User has non-interactive shell (/sbin/nologin)
✅ User entry exists in /etc/passwd
✅ User cannot login interactively
